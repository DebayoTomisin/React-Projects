This is a simple project for fetching and displaying data on tourist destinations and the possible cost implications of the trips, with users also given the choice to opt out of the tour

In the App js file, I don't like how i used the useEffect, I thought i could call the fetchTours function whilst it is inside the useEffect but for some reason it didn't work that way. I'll have to debug why that is 
Also the Loading component doesn't show when the page is fetching the tours data, go over that too
