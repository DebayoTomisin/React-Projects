Back to work people, i was sick for the past week that's why there was no actvitiy but now i'm back.

Nothing to see here really, just a young man building a grocery application, so basically this is just a todo list with cool features that allow you edit an item, remove individual items and display various commands while you're at it. 
It was relatively easy to do , Nothing to see here

Also i started working on some amazing projects that i will deploy in the coming weeks, one with typescript and the other with javascript. good times!
