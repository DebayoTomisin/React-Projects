This is the final project for this series. It's basically just an almagamation (whatever that means) of all the ideas and concepts learnt during this fun journey
I wanted to wrap this up in January but yeah (finally wrapping it up in April)

For more fun react stuffs check out other repos or the react playground repo for other interesting stuffs.

Nothing to see here folks!
