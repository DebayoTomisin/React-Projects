Nothing to see here folks, just a simple navbar project. 
So the idea behind this project was the use of useRef to store a reference of a dom properties of an object and modified the styling of the object on cetain conditions.

I'll be making a few changes and be using the react router dom for the links instead of the traditional anchor tags.
